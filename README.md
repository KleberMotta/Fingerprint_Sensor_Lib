/****************************************************************************
  This library was made for developers seeking an easy implementation of
  any generical fingerprint optical sensor listed in the comaptibility list
  of the read me file.

  Despite of being new to programing I decided to create this lib for 
  students or developers that, as me, might have found some trouble using 
  another libs out there when trying to use their fingerprint sensor for more 
  advanced implementations, such as extracting fingerprint templates, or
  the very images from their sensors, and exporting then to an external data base.

  This lib is under the GPU, General Public Licence, feel free to dowload it and modify
  at your will. I`ll let some intructions grabed from the manual in a more didatic 
  way for beginers as me, since I had to strugle I little bit to start creating this lib.

  If you downloaded this lib from an external souce, please come visit the original link
  of its repository on my GitHUb -->https://github.com/KleberMotta/Fingerprint_Sensor_Lib/
