  Welcome to the Finger Print Lib that will help you to use External DataBase in your projetcs,
  And simplify the process of extracting data for any possible reason you may want.

  This is an Arduino Finger Print Library for modules such as FPM10A, ZFM20, R3XX.
  It has support for any Finger Print Sensor that the famous Adafruit_Fingerprint lib has.
  It was made for developers seeking an easy implementation for more complex projects, 
  providing sample Sketchs that will help you with some "real life" implementations.

  Despite of being new to programing I decided to create this lib for students or developers that,
  like me, might have found some trouble using another libs out there when trying to use 
  their fingerprint sensor for more advanced projects, such as extracting fingerprint templates or IMAGES.

  This lib is under the GPU, General Public Licence, feel free to dowload it and modify
  at your will, since you give the deserved credit. I`ll let some intructions on the examples 
  in a more didatic way, manly for beginers, since I had to strugle with the documentations 
  And reliable examples I hope this helps someone. 

  Many thanks to Brian Ejike, this guy helped me with his article here -->https://futoedu.academia.edu/BrianEjike
  And even replyied my messages about some doubts I had.

  If you downloaded this lib from an external source, please come visit the original link
  of its repository on my GitHub -->https://github.com/KleberMotta/Fingerprint_Sensor_Lib
  Hopefully you'll give a job, or find something else there that you may like ;)
